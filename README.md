# Dynamic Calendar

A dynamic calendar is an interactive element on a web page that displays dates for a specific month or time range. This calendar is created using HTML, CSS, and javascript with a minimalist User Interface design for easy readability. There are 12 calendars from January to December, corresponding to the number of months in a year.

## Features

- Automatic date marker
- Automatically generate dates in each month
- Can generate dates in different years

## How does it work?

- **Automatic Marker**: Detecting dates in each month is different, if the date this month is the same as today, the marker will automatically indicate today's date.
- **Automatically generate dates**: Detecting mixed dates in this month with the previous or following month, if the date falls outside of this month, then the date will have a slightly faded color compared to the dates in this month.
- **Forever generate**: Every year changes, the calendar automatically generates for 12 months with different dates from the previous year, so no need to edit again if the year has changed.
